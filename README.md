# Story

A mysterious girl named Shino is found in a forest. Shino, wakes up in the forest without memories or recollection of her past. She is awakened by an elemental spirit, water, and asked her why she is laying there in the middle of the forest--she should flee. She is confused and does not know what is going on, so the spirit agrees to show her how to harness her power. Her power, revealed through story progression, indicates that she has always held this ability. The forest is engulfed in flames and she uses her newly attained water element to escape the forest.
