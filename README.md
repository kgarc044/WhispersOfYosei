# Story

A mysterious girl named Shino is found in a forest. Shino, wakes up in the forest without memories or recollection of her past. She is awakened by an elemental spirit, water, and asked her why she is laying there in the middle of the forest--she should flee. She is confused and does not know what is going on, so the spirit agrees to show her how to harness her power. Her power, revealed through story progression, indicates that she has always held this ability. The forest is engulfed in flames and she uses her newly attained water element to escape the forest.

Examples of obstructions would be flames scattered throughout the level that block the player's path. The player, Shino, will use the water element to clear the way towards their goal.
The team would like to implement most features using our own software and devices. For example we plan to create everything from level design, the soundtrack, main character assets, enemy assets and maybe some voice acting all custom made by the team's experience and software available.
